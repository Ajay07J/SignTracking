## Real-World Use Case

This system is perfect for club scenarios like:

2. Or implement a more secure admin invitation system

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase configuration
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that the database schema was applied successfully
